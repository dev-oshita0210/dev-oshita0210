### Hi there üëã

Blockchain development is well fit for me.

I worked as fullstack developer for 5 years, but now I don't want only major in web development.

Since 2020, I am working on Solana and Ethereum network as Blockchain developer.

It is very interesting to work on Decentralized Network.

- 5 years experience in Angular/React, PHP/Node.
- Solidity with 2 years experience for NFT marketplace and DeFi.
- Rust and Anchor framework experience in DeFi.
- Bridge between Ethereum and Solana Network using Wormhole.

Thanks.
